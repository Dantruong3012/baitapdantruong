      Food for thought: Life rarely goes exactly as planned, but sometimes the
      unexpected turns lead us to places far better than we imagined. Stay
      curious, keep learning, and trust that even small actions today can shape
      a brighter tomorrow. Never underestimate the power of one thoughtful
      decision.

    <p>
      When the flu season comes around, it can be helpful to refresh your
      knowledge of simple, at-home tips and tricks to help you manage your
      symptoms, particularly as the increased demand for health services puts
      the NHS under additional pressure.

      <strong> Meal of the week</strong>

    <p>
      Food for thought: A good meal of the week isn’t just about what’s on your
      plate, but about who’s at your table. Take time to savour each bite, share
      laughter, and create memories that feed more than just your hunger.
      Sometimes the best recipes are made with love, not just ingredients.

      <li>Prepare your favourite dish</li>
      <li>Enjoy a warm, cozy atmosphere</li>
